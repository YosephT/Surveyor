## Getting Started

After you have cloned this repo, run this setup script to set up your machine
with the necessary dependencies to run and test this app:

    % ./bin/setup

It assumes you have a machine equipped with Ruby, Postgres, etc. If not, set up
your machine with [this script].

After setting up, you can run the application using [foreman]:

    % foreman start

If you don't have `foreman`, see [Foreman's install instructions][foreman]. It
is [purposefully excluded from the project's `Gemfile`][exclude].

## Devise Setup

Some setup you must do manually if you haven't yet:

1. In production, :host should be set to the actual host of your application. Ensure you have defined default url options in your environments files. Here is an example of default_url_options appropriate for a development environment in config/environments/development.rb:

    ```ruby
    config.action_mailer.default_url_options = { host: 'localhost', port: 3000 }
    ```

2. Ensure you have defined root_url to *something* in your config/routes.rb. For example:

    ```ruby
    root to: "home#index"
    ```

3. Ensure you have flash messages in app/views/layouts/application.html.erb. For example:

    ```erb
    <p class="notice"><%= notice %></p>
    <p class="alert"><%= alert %></p>
    ```

4. On config/application.rb forcing your application to not access the DB or load models when precompiling your assets. If you are deploying on Heroku with Rails 3.2 only, you may want to set:

    ```ruby
    config.assets.initialize_on_precompile = false
    ```

5. You can copy Devise views (for customization) to your app by running:

    ```ruby
    rails g devise:views
    ```

## User Model

Inheritance, on the application layer:

    ```
    User
    | — Subject
    | — Researcher
    ```

Table Schema, simplified

    ```
    User
    | — Email
    | — Password
    | — Enum [Subject, Researcher]
    ```

When the application pulls from the database, it sees whether a user is a `subject` or `user`. Depending on the answer, rails would use the proper model, and thereby the associated permissions. Note: as of writing, the latter feature is not fully implemented.
